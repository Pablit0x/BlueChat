# BlueChat - Android Bluetooth Chat Application

**Note: BlueChat is currently a work in progress, and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) support is actively being developed.**

BlueChat is an Android application that enables users to send text messages and images to other paired devices over Bluetooth. The app is built using Kotlin and utilizes Jetpack Compose for the user interface, Kotlin Flows for asynchronous data streaming, and Coroutines for handling concurrent tasks.

## Features

- Establish Bluetooth connections with other devices.
- Send and receive text messages over Bluetooth.
- Send and receive images over Bluetooth.
- Change device Bluetooth name.
- Toggle Bluetooth on/off within the app.
- Set Bluetooth discoverability.
- Scan for new Bluetooth devices.
- Pair with new Bluetooth devices.
- Unpair already paired devices.
- Minimalistic and user-friendly UI using Jetpack Compose.
- Efficient data streaming and handling with Kotlin Flows and Coroutines.
